This is an angular2 frontend, written exclusively in JavaScript.

I will also try to document the process of 'translating' the sometimes typescript-exclusive angular2 documentation into a decently working Angular2 app written in pure Javascript, where possible.

Features in development:
* Test the navbar and carousel bootstrap ui elements using ng-bootstrap and angular2 alone
* Custom angular2 animations
* Add splits, double downs, and proper blackjack declaration to the blackjack Javascript game
